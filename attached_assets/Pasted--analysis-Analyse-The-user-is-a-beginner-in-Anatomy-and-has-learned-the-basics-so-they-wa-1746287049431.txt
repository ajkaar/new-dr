    "analysis": "Analyse: The user is a beginner in Anatomy and has learned the basics, so they want to prepare for NEET PG.\n\nPlan: For a beginner in Anatomy, I should first ask 3 questions of difficulty level 1 on a scale of 1 to 10, followed by 3 questions of difficulty level 2-3, and then 4 questions of difficulty level 4-5, ensuring that all questions are relevant to NEET PG.\n\nWork: For questions of difficulty 1/10, a beginner student of Anatomy should know about basic anatomical terminology, the major body systems, and simple skeletal anatomy. For questions of difficulty 2/10, a beginner should know about the major functions of different systems and identification of structures on the human body. For questions of difficulty 4-5/10, a beginner should know about specific anatomical relationships and clinical correlations.\n\n",
