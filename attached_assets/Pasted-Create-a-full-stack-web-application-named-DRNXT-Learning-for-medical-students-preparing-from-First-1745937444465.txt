Create a full-stack web application named "DRNXT Learning" for medical students preparing from First Year to NEET PG level.

The app must include the following core modules:

1. Dashboard: Personalized user dashboard with progress tracking and notifications.
2. AI Chatbot: Medical Assistant chatbot answering academic and clinical questions using OpenAI GPT-4o.
3. Diagnosis Tool: Symptom-based AI diagnosis assistant referencing standard textbooks like Harrisonâ€™s.
4. Quiz Generator: 
   - Real-time dynamic MCQ generator based on subject, topic, and difficulty.
   - Reference standard medical books (Harrison, Robbins, Guyton, etc).
   - Timed quizzes + performance analytics.
5. NEET PG Prep:
   - Stored Previous Year Question Banks.
   - Mock Test Creation.
   - Timer + performance tracking.
6. AI Memory Booster:
   - Simplify complex topics into mnemonics, analogies, and easy language.
7. Case Generator:
   - Generate new clinical case studies daily, aligned to Indian MBBS curriculum.
8. Voice Assistant:
   - Voice-to-text query for chatbot and diagnosis tool.
9. Drug Assistant:
   - Database lookup and GPT-4o summaries for drugs' class, MOA, indications, and side effects.
10. AI Study Planner:
    - User inputs goal exam, time left, subjects.
    - AI suggests daily and weekly study plans, adapting over time.
11. AI-Powered Notes Maker:
    - User inputs topic.
    - AI generates ready-to-study summarized notes with key points, mnemonics, diagrams.
12. Medical News (MedFeed):
    - Newsfeed section showing exam updates, medical news, residency information.
    - Notification system for urgent news.
    - Admin can push ads or updates inside feed.
13. Subscription System:
    - free trail of 20000 token after that it will be option for subscribe for rs 30000 (price should be changed)
14. Authentication:
    - Email/Google signup/login.
    - JWT session management.
    - Forgot password/reset support.
15-help and support section
16. Admin Panel:
    - Newsfeed Management (add/edit/delete news).
    - Ads/Announcement Management.
    - Coupon Management (add/edit/delete coupons).
    - View user stats and subscriptions.

Tech Requirements:
- Frontend: Next.js or React.js (with clean modern UI).
- Backend: Node.js + Express or FastAPI.
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
- Authentication: JWT.
- APIs must be modular and scalable.
- AI integrations via OpenAI GPT-4o API (support future GPT versions easily).

Additional Important Notes:
- Push Notifications system inside app.
- All quizzes/tests must show timer and progress tracking.
- User dashboard must show recent activity (e.g., quizzes taken, cases solved, notes made).
- App must be mobile-responsive (adaptive for mobile users).
- Admin can manually send pop-up announcements for important updates or offers.
- Codebase should be clean, modular, easily extendable.
- Developer/Owner should be able to update GPT prompts easily if needed later.
- App should be production-ready and scalable.

Final Goal:
The platform should deeply solve real-world problems for Indian medical students by improving clinical knowledge, memory retention, exam preparation, and practical learning through AI and automation.
