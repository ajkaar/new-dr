how to design + implement this page in your web app, both frontend and backend—so it works just like the case format you showed. 👇

🖥️ Frontend (Page Layout)
✅ Page Components:
Case Display Section:

Shows the current case step-by-step.

Uses a Card UI for each part (e.g., patient presentation, history, investigations).

Asks the user questions like:

"What is your initial impression?"

"What’s your diagnosis?"

User Input Fields:

Textareas or input boxes for users to type their answers.

Submit button after each question (or one final submit at the end).

Case Flow:

Use accordion / stepper / timeline layout to progress step-by-step:

Step 1 ➔ Step 2 ➔ Step 3 ➔ ... until the answer + tip is revealed.

AI Feedback:

When the user submits their diagnosis, show:

✅ Correct diagnosis (from AI).

💡 Tip: A learning point (from AI).

Enhancements:

Progress bar (shows how far the case has gone).

Button: "Generate New Case" to fetch a new case from the backend.

Optional: Timer to make it more exam-like.

⚙️ Backend (API Design)
You’ll need one API endpoint:

➡️ POST /case/generate

🔄 What it does:
Takes optional parameters like:

specialty: (e.g., "Medicine", "Surgery")

difficulty: (e.g., "easy", "moderate", "hard")

Uses your AI prompt (from earlier) to generate a case and returns structured JSON like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "case": {
    "patient_presentation": "A 45-year-old male with chest pain radiating to the left arm for 2 hours.",
    "initial_question": "What is your initial impression?",
    "history": "Risk factors: smoker, diabetic, hypertensive.",
    "exam_findings": "BP: 90/60, Pulse: 110 bpm, JVP raised.",
    "investigations": "ECG shows ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF.",
    "diagnosis_question": "What’s your diagnosis?",
    "ai_answer": "Acute Inferior Wall MI.",
    "tip": "Always check for RV infarct in inferior MIs."
  }
}
🗄️ Database (Optional)
Save user attempts to track:

Which cases were attempted.

User’s answers + AI feedback.

Timestamp for performance tracking.

🔑 Authentication:
Page should only work for logged-in users.

Track performance in their dashboard.

🛠️ Tech Suggestion:
Frontend:

React (with Tailwind CSS for beautiful UI)

Use react-query or axios to fetch the case.

Backend:

Node.js/Express or Flask/FastAPI

Connect to GPT-4 or your GPT-4 mini API.

MongoDB (for storing user attempts) or PostgreSQL.

🎯 Final Prompt (For GPT-4 AI):
Same as the prompt I gave earlier—that goes into your backend code (like calling OpenAI API with structured prompts).

✅ What to Build:
Feature	Component / API
Show case step-by-step	React UI Cards + Accordion/Stepper
Take user inputs	TextArea + Submit button
Get new case	POST /case/generate (calls GPT API)
Show answer + tip	After user submits diagnosis
Track performance	Save to DB + show in Dashboard
Generate new case	Button: "Generate New Case"
