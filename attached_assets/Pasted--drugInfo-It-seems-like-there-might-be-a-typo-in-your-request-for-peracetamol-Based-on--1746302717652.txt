  "drugInfo": "It seems like there might be a typo in your request for \"peracetamol.\" Based on the context, it's likely you meant \"paracetamol,\" which is also known as acetaminophen in the United States. I'll provide comprehensive information about paracetamol below:\n\n### Paracetamol (Acetaminophen)\n\n#### 1. Drug Class and Mechanism of Action\n- **Class**: Analgesic and Antipyretic\n- **Mechanism of Action**: Paracetamol works primarily by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) in the brain, which reduces the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in pain and fever. Unlike NSAIDs, it does not have significant anti-inflammatory effects as it does not inhibit COX enzymes in peripheral tissues.\n\n#### 2. FDA-approved Indications\n- Relief of mild to moderate pain (e.g., headaches, muscle aches, arthritis, toothaches, backaches)\n- Reduction of fever\n\n#### 3. Common Off-label Uses in Clinical Practice\n- Treatment of osteoarthritis pain\n- Migraine management as part of combination therapies\n- Febrile conditions in pediatric populations\n\n#### 4. Dosing Guidelines (Standard Adult Doses)\n- **Pain and Fever**: 325-650 mg every 4 to 6 hours or 1000 mg every 6 to 8 hours. The maximum daily dose should not exceed 3000 to 4000 mg to reduce the risk of hepatotoxicity. Itâ€™s crucial to consider all sources of paracetamol when calculating the total daily dose.\n\n#### 5. Important Side Effects and Adverse Reactions\n- **Common**: Generally well-tolerated at recommended doses\n- **Adverse Effects**: \n  - Overdose can lead to severe hepatotoxicity and potentially fatal liver failure.\n  - Allergic reactions, though rare, may include rash, itching/swelling, severe dizziness, or trouble breathing.\n\n#### 6. Key Drug Interactions to Be Aware Of\n- **Alcohol**: Increased risk of liver damage due to additive hepatotoxic effects.\n- **Warfarin**: Prolonged use of high doses may enhance the anticoagulant effect, increasing the risk of bleeding.\n- **Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Rifampin**: These may reduce paracetamol's effectiveness as they increase its metabolism.\n\n#### 7. Contraindications\n- **Severe hepatic impairment or active liver disease**: Due to the risk of inducing liver failure.\n- **Hypersensitivity** to paracetamol or any component of the formulation.\n\n#### 8. Special Considerations\n- **Pregnancy**: Paracetamol is generally considered safe for use during pregnancy and is often the recommended analgesic/antipyretic. However, it should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary.\n- **Renal Dosing**: Generally safe, but use caution in cases of chronic renal insufficiency.\n- **Hepatic Dosing**: Reduction in dose or frequency is recommended in patients with hepatic impairment or in situations where severe liver dysfunction is anticipated. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is advised in such cases.\n\n### Educational Summary\nParacetamol or acetaminophen is a key medication widely used for its analgesic and antipyretic properties. Its relative safety at prescribed doses makes it a first-line treatment for mild to moderate pain and fever. Careful monitoring of total doses and awareness of potential drug interactions and contraindications can help mitigate risks of adverse reactions, most notably those affecting the liver. In clinical practice, conservative use and patient education on dosing can optimize therapeutic outcomes while minimizing potential harms.",
